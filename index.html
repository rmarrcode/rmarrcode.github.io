            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Newgrad from the University of Minnestoa. In my undergraduate years, I focused on theoretical algorithms and 
            data intensive computation (Parallel Computing and Distributed Systems). I'm hoping to apply these skills to solve 
            interesting problems. So far I've applied my skills in the domains of finance and medical imaging.</p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Canon Medical Systems (formerly Vital Images)</h3>
            <p>Improved the Auto Coronary algorithm, which is designed to automatically detect blood vessels in CT scans of the
               human heart. Made the algorithm less susceptible to producing distorted results on certain inputs. I worked on
               image prepossessing and image segmentation</p>
            <p>Generated 2D images of heart models to maximize views of certain vessels.</p>
			<p>Tested the extent to which Docker enables Vital’s software to be run on the cloud. Doing so enables reliability with
                customers.</p>
            
            <h3>Intrinsic Quality</h3> 
            <p>Helped in developing a Database that enables employees to manage sales orders. I designed the database and
                wrote queries to meet Intrinsic Quality’s needs. This allows them to easily monitor which items are in stock.</p>
            <p>This system is currently used to generate all of the quotes and sales orders that are sent to clients.</p>
            
            <h3>MN Quants</h3>
            <p>Worked on the backend of a commodity price tracking application which is now being used by Cargill. This involved
                writing software to retrieve data from various commodity exchanges. After being scraped, data was processed and
                put in a database.</p>
            <p>Discussed algorithmic trading papers and implemented our own strategies to maximize earnings.</p>

            <h3>University of Minnesota Algorims club founder</h3>
            <p>Created the club with a few of my peers. This club is used as an opportunity to master the use of algorithms in
                theory and practice.</p> 
            <p>Represented the University of Minnesota in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) at the
                divisional level. This contest tests college level student’s ability to design and implement algorithms to solve
                problems.</p>

            <h3>University of Minnesota Teaching assistant</h3>
            <p> Advanced Programming Principles. Taught students how to work with Git, create large-scale programs in OCaml and understand the functional programming paradigm. I held my own office hours and graded assignments. </p>
